# order-management
a.	How to build the application.

1) Backend Implementation:
   
 Implement the necessary entities, repositories, services, and controllers based on the database diagram.

Implement the business logic for managing the entities, including CRUD operations, entity relations, and any additional business rules.

2)Implement Entity Relations:

Based on the database diagram, define and implement the necessary relationships between entities using JPA annotations such as @OneToMany, @ManyToMany.

Ensure the relationships are properly managed and that the database schema matches the desired structure.

3)Best Practices and Constraints:

Follow best practices for software development, including modular and reusable code, separation of concerns, and error handling.

Apply constraints and validations on input data to ensure data integrity and consistency.

Implement exception handling to gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful error messages.

4)Secure APIs and Use Swagger Documentation:

Implement a signup API and authentication mechanism to secure the APIs.

Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization.

Integrate Swagger documentation to document and expose the APIs to users.

5)Postman Collection:

Create a Postman collection to test the APIs for each resource method.

Include all the necessary request URLs, headers, request bodies, and expected responses.
